Semester project called Community Science Museum

## Description

For our semester project, we've given a task to create a science museum. Where a family and kids can check on the website about things they can see at the museum, events they can join and many more. The purpose of this projec is to see if we can follow the discriptions given to us. If we can create a website using HTML and CSS and if we can make it responsive for both mobile and computer screens. I also made prototype using adobe xd. 

- Prototype and style tile using adobe XD
- Focused on UX-UI and Accessibility
- Created codes using Visual Studio Code
- Purely HTML and CSS
- 100% responsive
